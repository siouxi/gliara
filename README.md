# Gliara: An AI Classifier for Alzheimer's 🧠💡

**Gliara** is an exciting neuroscience project aiming to develop a precise **AI classifier for Alzheimer's disease**. 🤖🔍 This progressive neurodegenerative condition impacts millions, making early and accurate diagnosis crucial. 🌟

By leveraging advanced **machine learning** and **neuroimaging data** (fMRI, PET, MRI), Gliara will detect subtle patterns indicative of Alzheimer's. 📊🧠 Our goal is to provide a more holistic predictive model, integrating insights into both neuronal connectivity and glial function. 🚀 This project represents a significant leap in applying AI to public health, transforming how we diagnose and understand this devastating disease. 💜
